### 1. Retrieve a card from a stack

- Note that the array index starts from `0`.

### 2. Exchange a card in the stack

- The array is a mutable structure, you can change its content anytime.

### 3. Create a stack of cards

- The `push` method adds a new value at the end of the array. *e.g.* `array.push(newValue)`
 
### 4. Remove a card from the stack

- `splice` is a versatile method, which among other use cases, can be used to remove elements starting at a certain position. The first parameter is the starting index and the second one is the number of elements to be removed. *e.g.* `array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount)`

### 5. Remove the top card from the stack

- The `pop` method removed the last element from the array. *e.g.* `array.push(newValue)`

### 6. Check size of the stack

- Any array's length can be determined by using the `length` property on the array object.
